 As its name would imply, this program can encrypt your data, and decrypt it; along with some additional features like KDF, hash and base64 encoding.

Encryption is turning your data into something unreadable, which can only be turned back to its original form using a digital key. This program lets you do this.

To decrypt the data that you had encrypted using a symmetric key encryption algorithm (AES or 3DES) with this program, you need to have the key called "the encryption key", which you had used to encrypt your data, or was generated and shown to you. This key consists of either 16, 24 or 32 random characters. Since the same key can be used to both encrypt and decrypt, these kinds of algorithms are called symmetric. Similarly, to decrypt a piece of asymmetrically encrypted data (using RSA algorithm), you need to have a key called "private key" which is usually longer than 1024 characters. In order to have two or more pieces of data be decryptable using the same private key, you need to encrypt them with the same public key, which can be extracted from the private key. Because there are two different keys involved in this process, these algorithms are called asymmetric.

Asymmetric key encryption is not available yet though. It'll be available in the next update.
